## Description
If you’re already familiar with Vue 2 & The Options API, this small project will teach you everything you need to know to switch over to (and get started with) Vue 3 & the amazing new Composition API.


### You’ll then master all of the basics including:

- Reactive data with Refs & Reactive Objects
- Methods, Computed Properties & Watchers
- Lifecycle Hooks
- Directives
- Vue Router
- Child Components - including the new ways of handling props, emits & modelValue
- Dynamic Components
- Composables - how to create them from scratch & how to import them from the VueUse library

And you’ll learn State Management using Pinia, the incredible successor to Vuex

After learning the basics, you’re gonna create a real world app called Noteballs from scratch - which has full CRUD capabilities, uses Pinia for State Management and demonstrates real-world use of all the basics you learned earlier.
